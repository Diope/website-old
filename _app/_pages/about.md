Welcome to my blog. It's become standard for all developers to have their own slice of internet real estate, so I thought "It's time". On this small site you will find my thoughts on various things ranging from web development woes to reviews and critiquing pop culture (you know, music, movies, TV shows...all of which I consume very little of...). Follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tunghsiao) that I don't utilize nearly enough, or shoot me an email at [dkp@dipet.me](mailto:dkp@dipet.me) where I respond promptly.
