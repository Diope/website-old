Ruby is an object oriented programming language. It's so object oriented that everything is basically an object! I am of the belief that everyone should learn how to program. The logic portion of programming pays dividends in other areas and makes you a more well rounded person. I've been learning Ruby for the last 3 months and I absolutely love how expressive you can be with the language and the many upon many ways you can write your code and achieve the desired end result.

Programming has long been met with this stigma that you either can or can't program and that the ability to do so is innate and if you miss out on that window you'll never learn. I think this line of belief was born of the fact that many schools (and individuals who decided to teach themselves) went after a language that didn't resonate with the person (I mean think of the number of schools out there that start people off with C++). 

I've attempted to program in the past and have had mixed results, the first language I ever attempted to learn was C++ taught by someone who to this day I feel was not qualified to be teaching the students anything. He'd introduce functions, arrays, loops, without proper explanation on what they do or at the very least giving examples of their use. It was also this teacher that made me hate taking community college classes while I was in highschool (I actually had just entered HS at the time).

I think anyone can learn to program at any time in their lives. It's really about finding the programming language syntax that resonates with you. Some people flock to Javascript, others pick up C#, and others Python. Once you start to learn the basics of programming, the mindset and logic needed, picking up a new language becomes much simpler. But make no mistake, programming is a lifelong journey, you'll never be a master as there is always something to learn. Unless you're someone like John Carmack or Corrinne Yu...
