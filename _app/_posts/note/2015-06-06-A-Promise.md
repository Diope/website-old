I told myself that on my journey in web development that I would keep a records of sorts on my findings and views on both the technology the industry uses and the interaction between the people who work in the industry.

>Do or don't...damn it son just try!

I'll consider this my official declaration to actually update this blog and be as consistent as possible on updating it. I plan to cover a myriad of things on the blog and not limit it to just web development. I'll probably use this as my hub for random reviews of products I purchase and perhaps as a repository of sorts for doodles and the like. At the very least i can say that I took a major step in actually getting myself to write more.

Despite evidence that suggests otherwise, I do enjoy writing about as much as I enjoy sleeping, learning, drawing (that is to say I love it quite a bit), but you would never know from my overall lack of enthusiasm, but make no mistake i do like to write. Send me an email and I'll reply in novella form.
